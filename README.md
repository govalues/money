Package money implements immutable monetary amounts for Go.

## Getting started

To install the money package into your Go workspace, you can use the go get command:

```bash
go get github.com/govalues/money
```

To use the money package in your Go project, you can import it as follows:

```go
import (
    "github.com/govalues/decimal"
    "github.com/govalues/money"
)
```

## Using Amount

To create a new amount, you can use one of the provided constructors,
such as `NewAmount`, `MustNewAmount`, `ParseAmount` or `MustParseAmount`.

```go
d := decimal.MustNew(12345, 2)              // d = 123.45
a := money.MustNewAmount(money.USD, d)      // a = USD 123.45
b := money.MustParseAmount("USD", "123.45") // b = USD 123.45
```

Once you have an amount, you can perform arithmetic operations such as
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, as well
as rounding operations such as ceiling, floor, truncation, and rounding.

```go
sum, _ := a.Add(b)
difference, _ := a.Sub(b)
product, _ := a.Mul(d)
quotient, _ := a.Quo(d)
ratio, _ := a.Rat(b)
ceil := a.Ceil(2)
floor := a.Floor(2)
trunc := a.Trunc(2)
round := a.Round(2)
```

For more details on these and other methods, see the package documentation at [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/govalues/money).
